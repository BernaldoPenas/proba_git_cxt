echo "God save the queen
the fascist regime,
they made you a moron
a potential h-bomb.
God save the queen
she ain't no human being.
there is no future
in england's dreaming
Don't be told what you want
don't be told what you need.
there's no future
there's no future
there's no future for you
God save the queen
we mean it man
we love our queen
god saves
God save the queen
'cos tourists are money
and our figurehead
is not what she seems
Oh god save history
god save your mad parade
oh lord god have mercy
all crimes are paid.
When there's no future
how can there be sin
we're the flowers
in the dustbin
we're the poison
in your human machine
we're the future
you're future
God save the queen
we mean it man
we love our queen
god saves
God save the queen
we mean it man
there is no future
in england's dreaming
No future
no future for you
no fufure for me"
