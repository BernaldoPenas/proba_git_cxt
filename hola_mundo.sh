echo "Right! now ha, ha
I am an anti-christ
i am an anarchist,
don't know what i want
but i know how to get it.
i wanna destroy the passer by
'cos i wanna be anarchy,
no dogs body
Anarchy for the uk
it's coming sometime and maybe
i give a wrong time stop a traffic line.
your future dream is a shopping scheme
cause i wanna be anarchy,
it's in the city
How many ways to get what you want
i use the best i use the rest
i use the enemy.
i use anarchy
'cause i wanna be anarchy,
Its the only way to be
Is this the mpla
or is this the uda
or is this the ira
i thought it was the uk
or just another country
another council tenancy.
I wanna be an anarchist
(oh what a name)
and l wanna be an anarchist
(i get pissed destroy)"
